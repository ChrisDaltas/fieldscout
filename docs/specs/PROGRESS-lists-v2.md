## 2. Round 1 task checklist

Task text: **delivery plan §4**, read with the handoff section each task cites.
Dependencies in parentheses; pick the first unchecked task whose dependencies
are all checked.

**Phase 1 — foundations**

- [x] **LV.1.1** — `featureFlags.listsV2` + route-level branch so old and new Lists coexist (2026-08-09)
- [ ] **LV.1.2** — migration: `list_player_drafted (user_id, list_id, player_id)` + RLS + indexes, and its read/toggle route (D2)
- [ ] **LV.1.3** — point `use-draft-mode.ts` **only** at the new server source (LV.1.2)
- [ ] **LV.1.4** — session-only display state: `view`, `cols`, band labels, `budget`; **no `persist` middleware** (D3)
- [ ] **LV.1.5** — widen the tier route's Zod enum for round/band buckets beyond six; S–F stays valid (D4)

**Phase 2 — Lists page**

- [ ] **LV.2.1** — page header: heading, view-mode segmented control, My lists / Saved tabs, New list (LV.1.1)
- [ ] **LV.2.2** — rail mode: 200px sticky rail, shared edge, selected-row treatment (LV.2.1)
- [ ] **LV.2.3** — cards mode: responsive gallery, flat at rest, lift on hover (LV.2.1)

**Phase 3 — list detail**

- [ ] **LV.3.1** — hero: cover, inline rename, byline, action cluster, options menu (LV.1.1)
- [ ] **LV.3.2** — tabs + toolbar: grouping dropdown, view-style toggle, Stats, Add players (LV.3.1, LV.1.4)
- [ ] **LV.3.3** — view style List: 60px rows, stat cells, computed `minWidth` (LV.3.2)
- [ ] **LV.3.4** — view style Table: 44px rows, sticky header (LV.3.2)
- [ ] **LV.3.5** — view style Cards: corner cells, stat strip, label rail (LV.3.2)
- [ ] **LV.3.6** — drag-and-drop across all three views; header drop assigns the bucket (LV.3.3–3.5, LV.1.5)
- [ ] **LV.3.7** — stats picker modal: grouped catalog, search, reorderable chips (LV.3.2)
- [ ] **LV.3.8** — notes: accent mark + body-portalled hover card (LV.3.3)
- [ ] **LV.3.9** — drafted checkbox + "Clear drafted" (LV.1.3, LV.3.3)

**Phase 4 — states and cutover**

- [ ] **LV.4.1** — loading / empty / error / overflow states (LV.3.*)
- [ ] **LV.4.2** — AI list generation + persona surfaces restyled (LV.3.*)
- [ ] **LV.4.3** — public share view, still server-rendered (LV.3.*)
- [ ] **LV.4.4** — flag flip + retire old components (all)

**Lane note:** LV.1.1, LV.1.2, LV.1.4 and LV.1.5 are independent and may be
picked in any order. LV.1.2 is the only schema task in the build.

## 3. Design questions

*(A Builder that finds the handoff wrong or ambiguous files the question here
with a recommendation and HALTs — it never improvises.)*

None open.

## 4. Decisions log

Design decisions D1–D7 live in delivery plan §3 and are not duplicated here.
This section records decisions made **during** the build.

- **LV.1.1 (2026-08-09) — branch mechanism.** Both routes
  (`src/app/app/lists/page.tsx`, `src/app/app/lists/[listId]/page.tsx`) now
  check `featureFlags.listsV2` as the first statement in the default export
  and return early to a new `*V2` component when on. The pre-existing body
  of each page moved, unedited, into a same-file `*Legacy` component
  (`ListsPageLegacy`, `ListDetailPageLegacy`) — this was required, not
  stylistic: `useList`/`useAiListBuild`/`useHistoryStore`/`useState` are real
  hooks, so they can't sit in the branch itself without violating
  react-hooks/rules-of-hooks (confirmed clean via `npm run lint`). `use(props.params)`
  is exempt from that rule per React/Next 15 and stays in the outer
  component so both branches can read `listId`. New placeholder components
  live at `src/components/lists/v2/{lists-page-v2,list-detail-page-v2}.tsx`,
  built on the existing `PlaceholderPage` shared component (same pattern as
  `src/app/app/teams/[teamId]/page.tsx`) rather than inventing new markup.

  **Where `src/components/lists/v2/` comes from is now plan law, not a note
  here** — this entry originally carried a Builder's counter-reading of D1,
  which was the wrong place for it (R168). Plan **v3.3** amends D1 in place:
  Lists v2 screens live in `src/components/lists/v2/`, are swapped in at the
  route branch, and are retired at LV.4.4; "no forks of `src/components/ui/`
  primitives" survives as the absolute prohibition. **Read D1, not this
  bullet.** No task should re-derive the structure.

  Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_LISTS_V2` to `.env.example` beside the other flags.
  **Its dev default takes something away, which no previous flag did**
  (R170): unset or blank means ON in local development, so until LV.2.1 and
  LV.3.1 land, `npm run dev` shows placeholders where today's working Lists
  page and list detail are. That is what plan §1 asks for — the rebuild is
  what you want to see locally — but it is surprising the first time, so
  `.env.example` now says it outright, along with the escape hatch:
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_LISTS_V2=false` in `.env.local` restores today's Lists
  locally. `.env.local` itself is gitignored and was used only transiently
  for the flag-OFF browser verification.

## 6. Review findings

*(Reviewer findings per cycle, in house format.)*

### LV.1.1 — 2026-08-09 (PR #107) — verdict **FIX-THEN-MERGE**

*Reviewer session (fresh context, red-team brief) against PR #107 —
`featureFlags.listsV2` + the route-level branch — verified against plan v3.2
§1/§4/§5, D1, and the `.env.example` / `feature-flags.ts` conventions. Method
included a deliberate-break probe (inverting both branch conditions) run
against the full DoD gate. **R166–R170: three should-fix, two nits, no
blockers.**

**The finding that mattered:** the PR added **zero** tests (656 = 656 against
main's baseline), so nothing anywhere was falsifiable against the branch
*direction* or the flag's deployed default. The Reviewer inverted both
conditions to `if (!featureFlags.listsV2)` — the change that would replace
production Lists with the "coming soon" placeholder for every user — and the
entire gate stayed green: type-check clean, lint exit 0, `test:unit` 39
files / 656 tests passed.*

#### Resolution — 2026-08-09 (Builder, same branch `feat/LV.1.1-lists-v2-flag-and-route-branch`)

*All five resolved on the same branch; nothing deferred, nothing escalated.
Proof re-run this session: `type-check` clean · `lint` exit 0 (only the
pre-existing `auction-draft-room.tsx:105` warning) · `test:unit` **40 files /
663 tests** — above the 656 baseline by the 7 tests R166 required.*

| Finding | Severity | Resolved by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **R166** — nothing falsifiable against the branch direction or the flag's deployed default | should-fix | **`src/lib/lists-v2-flag.test.ts`** (new, 7 tests), following the `launch-scope-gates.test.ts` idiom the house already owns. Pins (a) `featureFlags.listsV2 === false` under the deployed default (unset var, `NODE_ENV=test`), (b) `=== true` under the local-dev default via `vi.stubEnv('NODE_ENV','development')` + `resetModules`, (c) the literal `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_LISTS_V2` read (build-time inlining), (d) per route, the exact **un-negated** `if (featureFlags.listsV2) {` **plus** an ordering assertion that the v2 screen is returned *inside* the ON branch and the `*Legacy` screen is the fallback below it, and (e) that the OFF path still mounts `PageHeader`/`ListsBrowse` and `ListDetailView`/`AiBuildBanner`/`CommentsThread`. **Shown falsifiable twice:** the Reviewer's exact probe → 2 RED, reverted → green; and a second probe swapping the two return bodies (same net effect, no negation) → 1 RED on the ordering assertion, reverted → green. `launch-scope-gates.test.ts` also gained a comment stating that `listsV2` is *not* a launch-scope gate and must not be deleted as one |
| **R167** — DoD §5.4 browser evidence asserted in prose, shown nowhere; the OFF-state check rendered the "List not found" error card, never the legacy happy path | should-fix | Re-verified from scratch against the **local** stack with a **real seeded 20-player list** owned by the dev user (`Draft Board — 2026 PPR`, seeded into the local DB only — nothing hosted touched). All 8 combinations re-run (2 routes × 2 flag states × 1440×900 / 375×812); the flag-OFF detail page rendered the full `ListDetailView` — hero, owner-only cover "Change", grouping selector, six tier sections, 20 players with PROJ/2025/ADP cells — **and** `CommentsThread`, with **zero console errors** on a clean tab. Verification log with rendered-text extracts written into the PR body; the PR states plainly that screenshots were taken locally and **cannot** be attached via `gh` (no image upload), rather than claiming attachments that do not exist |
| **R168** — plan §3 D1 ("New Lists replaces the bodies of existing components") contradicts the shipped `src/components/lists/v2/` structure, and the Builder resolved it unilaterally in PROGRESS §4 | should-fix | **Plan amended in place to v3.3** (changelog entry added). D1 now states that Lists v2 screens live in `src/components/lists/v2/`, are swapped in at the route branch, and are retired at LV.4.4 — with **"no forks of `src/components/ui/` primitives"** kept as the surviving absolute prohibition, and the §4/LV.4.4 derivation spelled out so none of the remaining twelve tasks re-derives it. §4 below now points at D1 instead of arguing with it. **Editorial reconciliation — no product decision** |
| **R169** — §1 Round 1 still read "🟡 Not started" with LV.1.1 ticked in §2 | nit | §1 Round 1 status → **🔵 In progress (LV.1.1 landed 2026-08-09)** |
| **R170** — `.env.example` documented only the `"true"` case; unset also routes to v2 in local dev, taking away a shipped surface | nit | `.env.example` comment expanded to say outright that blank = ON locally, that `npm run dev` therefore shows placeholders where Lists is today until LV.2.1/LV.3.1 land, and that `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_LISTS_V2=false` in `.env.local` restores today's Lists. Same note added to the §4 decision entry |

#### Re-review — 2026-08-09 (fresh Reviewer, fix diff `2c17a76`) — **VERDICT: CLEAN**

*Re-ran the full gate independently (type-check clean · lint exit 0 · `test:unit`
40 files / 663 tests) and corroborated the R167 fixture against the local DB —
tier counts and player rows matched the PR's rendered-text extract, so it could
not have been fabricated from the diff. R166 confirmed **load-bearing** by six
break-probes, four of which the fix Builder never claimed to cover: inverted
branch → 2 RED · flag read deleted → 1 RED · coherent flag rename across all
three files → 5 RED · `enabled(...) || true` (defeats the source pin, trips the
behavioral pin) → 1 RED · swapped return bodies → 1 RED. Behavioral and source
pins proved complementary rather than redundant.*

Two nits recorded, **not fixed** — both are inherent ceilings of the source-pin
idiom (the routes are `.tsx`, unparseable by Vite under Next's
`jsx: "preserve"`, which is why the house source-pins at all):

| Finding | Severity | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **R171** — `src/lib/lists-v2-flag.test.ts` locates the canonical `if (featureFlags.listsV2) {` but never asserts it is the *only* decider. A reachable shadow condition inserted *above* it (probe: `if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_LISTS_V2 !== 'false') return <ListsPageV2 />`) ships v2 to production with the gate green, because the ordering assertion only searches forward from the branch | nit | **Open.** Fix direction: assert the branch is the first statement of the default export, or that `<${v2}` occurs exactly once in the file. Worth folding into LV.2.1 when that task next opens these routes |
| **R172** — the "flag-OFF path still mounts today's Lists UI" assertion scans the whole file rather than the `*Legacy` body, so a mount dropped from the OFF render still passes if the same JSX survives elsewhere in the file. Outright deletion **is** caught; the miss window is narrow | nit | **Open.** Fix direction: slice the source to the `function ${legacy}` body before asserting mounts, or narrow the test name to what a whole-file pin can honestly claim |

-- 097 — the auto-pause post stops sending a league-less practice draft to a
--       league page (MP task MP.6c; ledger F120; spec v2.16 §8.8)
-- ============================================================================
--
-- ONE HUNK, and it is product copy inside `draft_tick`'s ARM 1.5 (the mock
-- stale-pause loop). The post is `draft_pause_internal`'s D97 system post and
-- it reads, verbatim since 068:947:
--
--     "Mock draft auto-paused — you left the room. Resume your practice from
--      the league page."
--
-- **A STANDALONE practice draft has no league page.** 095 made `league_id
-- IS NULL` legal without re-reading the copy it carries, and MP.6c is the
-- task that makes the sentence VISIBLE: F114's hook fix re-keys the room's
-- chat read on the draft's context, so the launcher now actually reads these
-- posts. Observed before the fix, not inferred: launching one standalone mock
-- through `/app/mocks` and leaving the room writes exactly that row with
-- `league_id` NULL and `context = 'draft:<mock id>'` (F120's own evidence).
--
-- **Why SQL and not a client transform.** The room could have rewritten the
-- tail sentence when `scope.leagueId === null`, and it would have been
-- cheaper. It would also have left a stored row that says something false —
-- read back by MP.8's report, by any future notification, and by anyone
-- looking at `league_chat` — and it would have been a client string-matching
-- a server's product copy, which is the opposite of D189(3) (the RPC's copy
-- is surfaced VERBATIM; callers never paraphrase it). The row should be true.
--
-- **Authored against HEAD, whole-function, per CLAUDE.md's migration
-- discipline.** `draft_tick`'s definers are
-- 068 -> 086 -> 087 -> 089 -> 091 -> 092 -> 093 -> 095, so the head is
-- **`095_standalone_mock.sql:1413-2396`** (re-derived with
-- `for f in supabase/migrations/*.sql; do grep -qE '^CREATE (OR REPLACE )?FUNCTION +(public\.)?draft_tick\(' "$f" && echo "$f"; done`).
-- The body below is that text COPIED, with the single `CASE` above the pause
-- call as the only edit — `diff` against the extracted head shows exactly one
-- hunk. Nothing else in ARM 1, 1.5, 2, 2.6 or 3 moves; no guard, no claim
-- predicate, no counter, no `draft_league_alive()` call is touched. (This is
-- the 073 lesson: a `CREATE OR REPLACE` written against anything but the head
-- silently reverts what came between.)
--
-- **§4 rule 11 — REAL LEAGUES AND REAL DRAFTS DO NOT CHANGE.** The `ELSE`
-- branch is 068's string byte-for-byte, so a LEAGUE-attached mock's post is
-- unchanged, and an `is_mock = FALSE` draft never reaches this loop at all
-- (the claim predicate is `d.is_mock`).
--
-- **§4.1 posture:** SECURITY DEFINER + `search_path = ''` + the REVOKE, all
-- re-emitted below exactly as 095 left them.
--
-- Proof: `standalone-actions-db.test.ts` drives the arm end to end on BOTH
-- shapes — a standalone mock and a league-attached one, each backdated past
-- the disconnect grace, `draft_tick()` called, the written `league_chat` row
-- read back — and the break probe (the CASE removed) is shown in the PR.

  -- ARM 1.5 — §8.7 commissioner-outage auto-pause (D102/§8.7:478; landed
  -- with L.B1.4/069 — see the banner). Runs BEFORE the timeout arm so an
  -- expired deadline under an outage pauses instead of autopicking (pinned:
  -- pgTAP 023 §H's R136 case — a deadline past deadline+grace under an
  -- outage pauses with NEGATIVE remaining and ZERO picks). The candidacy
  -- test covers ALL live non-mock drafts (not just due ones — the pause
  -- must freeze a still-running clock through the outage), but the CLAIM
  -- locks ONLY outage candidates (R135, M2 batch 5): the pre-fix
  -- unfiltered claim FOR UPDATE'd every live non-mock draft each tick and
  -- held the locks for the rest of the tick transaction, serializing every
  -- pick on every live draft behind the batch every 5s — against the
  -- §22.3/§22.6 load posture. The WHERE below is the same
  -- established-then-lost supervision predicate the body re-verifies UNDER
  -- the lock (claim = pre-filter against a snapshot; body = authoritative);
  -- a filter bug that over-claims costs only lock scope (pgTAP 023 §H's
  -- lock-visibility pins catch it), one that under-claims would miss the
  -- pause (023 §H's 76s-threshold pins catch that direction). Batch-capped
  -- at c_batch for symmetry with ARM 2 — no loop (an outage pause is
  -- idempotent and not deadline-urgent the way a timeout is). CORRECTED,
  -- R141 (batch-5 addendum): "overflow candidates are claimed on the next
  -- 5s tick" is guaranteed only INSIDE the ≤25-draft M2 gate, where the
  -- candidate set can never exceed c_batch. This claim has no ORDER BY, no
  -- loop, and no v_seen, so beyond the gate nothing rotates the batch:
  -- ≥ c_batch candidates that never leave the set (e.g. rows the body
  -- persistently fails on — recorded outage_failures) could recur in every
  -- batch while real outage candidates starve, and a starved candidate
  -- whose deadline is due is autopicked by ARM 2 in the SAME tick. The one
  -- known PERMANENT class (soft-deleted league) is excluded from the claim
  -- below; the beyond-gate rotation hazard is F50's (M7/L.F1 §22.6 load
  -- gate — the ARM-2 loop+v_seen shape is the fix when scale demands it).
  -- Freshness AS-OF-NOW; the never-connected exemption; resume is a
  -- commissioner action (the tick never auto-resumes).

  -- ARM 2.5 — MOCK CPU THINK-TIME PICKS (L.B1.6/071 — amended in place,
  -- F12; D93/§8.8, plan §4.2). Every non-human seat in a live mock picks
  -- when its think-time elapses: due = pick start + PRNG(draft_id,
  -- pick_number) → 20–70% of the clock (`realistic`) or ~2s (`fast`) —
  -- draft_mock_cpu_due, the ONE due computation for claim AND re-check.
  -- THE PICK ITSELF IS THE AUTOPICK STRATEGY FN (draft_autopick_resolve →
  -- draft_apply_pick_internal — the same brain and the same advance path
  -- as a live timeout; "one implementation, two consumers" — the DoD
  -- break-probe target: a forked raw-ADP CPU fails 025's need-fit board
  -- pins). The human seat is NEVER touched by this arm (its clock is
  -- always real — §8.8; ARM 2 owns its timeout at the deadline). CLAIM
  -- SCOPE (R135/R141 + the task charge): the WHERE is the body's
  -- predicate — live + mock + CPU on clock + due + alive league — so a
  -- mock whose CPU is still thinking is NEVER locked. One CPU pick per
  -- mock per pass (the think origin is the advance instant, so the next
  -- pick's due is always in the future at apply time): `fast` ≈ 2s
  -- think-time lands on the first tick after it elapses — effective
  -- cadence bounded by the 5s tick, the same granularity class D87
  -- records for timeout lag (recorded residual). Runs AFTER ARM 2 (a
  -- deadline-expired mock CPU seat is ARM 2's immediate autopick; the
  -- fresh deadline it writes puts the next due in the future) and BEFORE
  -- ARM 3 (a just-made CPU pick's fresh deadline beats in the same pass).
  -- 086/R362 — AUCTIONS ARE EXCLUDED HERE TOO, in the claim AND the
  -- under-lock re-verify, for the same reason ARM 2 is: this arm's pick
  -- path is draft_autopick_resolve → draft_apply_pick_internal, the SNAKE
  -- writer. The exclusion is not inferred from that intent — it was
  -- MEASURED on this branch before the two lines were added. A privileged
  -- fixture (a live is_mock=true, draft_type='auction' draft, a CPU seat
  -- on the clock, cpu_speed 'fast' so the think-time is due while the
  -- deadline is still 30s away, started_at fresh so ARM 1.6 cannot claim
  -- it) put through one draft_tick() returned "mock_cpu_picked": 1 and
  -- wrote draft_picks(pick_number=1, round=1, price=NULL, is_auto=t,
  -- made_via='autopick'), advanced current_pick_number to 2, recorded
  -- ZERO draft_bids and left current_nomination NULL — the EXACT shape
  -- this migration closes for ARM 2, reached through a second door.
  -- It is unreachable today (071's create_mock_draft refuses auction
  -- configs and a mock's draft_type is snapshotted at creation; 085's
  -- verbs refuse mocks — F61), so it was never a live defect; it is fixed

  -- non-NULL ⇒ the BID clock expired. Runs AFTER ARM 2.5 and BEFORE ARM 3
  -- exactly as tasks-M3 §6 sequences it, so an award or a system nomination
  -- is reflected in the same pass's heartbeat.
  -- CLAIM SCOPE (R135/R141): the WHERE is the body's own predicate — live +
  -- auction + due + alive league — so an auction mid-clock is never locked
  -- by this arm, and every predicate is re-verified under the held lock
  -- below. The c_batch ceiling and its >25-candidate rotation behaviour are
  -- ARM 2's, inherited deliberately: tasks-M3 §10 routes that to F50 (M7)
  -- and says ARM 2.6 shares it with no new row.
  -- MOCKS ARE IN (089/L.C1.7 — D132/D138): 086 excluded them while they were
  -- unreachable (071 refused auction mocks; 085's verbs refused them —
  -- F61, now discharged) and D160(9) said this task opens the claim. A mock
  -- auction runs the SAME two sub-arms — its nomination timeouts (the human
  -- seat under the LAUNCHER's grace, a CPU seat immediately — ARM 2's mock
  -- branch, mirrored below), its awards, its rotation and its completion
  -- (the writer's §8.8 mock bypass: drafts.complete + recap, zero
  -- league_rosters, no league transition). What a mock ADDS is the CPU
  -- sub-arm, ARM 2.6(c) below: CPU nominations on their think-time and CPU
  -- raises on theirs, both through the extracted internals the human path
  -- uses (089 banner items 3–5).

  -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- ARM 2.6(c) — THE MOCK CPU SUB-ARM (089/L.C1.7; §8.8 "auction bots bid
  -- value-based … and pass the same max-bid/solvency validator as humans";
  -- D132/D138; D128 — the clock rule is the same INSERT + UPDATE). Runs
  -- BEFORE the expiry loop and is DISJOINT from it by construction: this
  -- claim requires the clock to be RUNNING (`current_deadline > now()`), the
  -- expiry loop requires it to have run OUT (`<= now()`) — so no CPU ever
  -- nominates or raises after the buzzer (a think-time that lands past zero
  -- simply misses), and an award in the same pass is the expiry loop's.
  -- CLAIM SCOPE (R135/R141): the WHERE is the body's predicate — live + mock
  -- + auction + alive league + clock running + think-time DUE via the ONE
  -- due computation (`draft_mock_auction_cpu_due`, claim ≡ re-check) — so a
  -- HEALTHY mock (think-time not yet reached) is never locked by this arm.
  -- Recorded residual (089 banner): a bidding-phase mock past its raise
  -- think-time is re-claimed each pass until a raise lands or the clock
  -- expires, even when every CPU folds — the claim cannot see the value
  -- model; the lock is one short read per pass.
  -- Two phases (D126):
  --   NOMINATING, CPU seat on the clock, think-time due → the CPU nominates
  --     through draft_system_nominate_internal (its OWN resolve chain at
  --     the nomination floor — D129(2); a CPU seat resolves as a no-user seat: ADP +
  --     need, never its real owner's prep — D110(4)). Think-time = 20–70%
  --     of the NOMINATION clock (the D93 PRNG seeded (draft, sequence)
  --     exactly as a snake CPU pick is) or ~2s under `fast`.
  --   BIDDING, raise think-time due → THE RESPONDER, once
  --     (draft_mock_cpu_respond_internal — 091/AP.3, D200(2)). What used to
  --     live inline here (the candidate scan and a hard-coded `+ $1`) is now
  --     ONE function shared with the reactive path, and the raise amount is
  --     the seeded curve of draft_mock_cpu_raise_amount.
  --     **AFTER 091 THIS ARM IS THE NO-ACTOR SAFETY NET, NOT THE
  --     HEARTBEAT** (§8.8: "a CPU raise is provoked by the bid it answers,
  --     never by the sweep"; D200(1)). A ladder normally resolves inside the
  --     transaction that provoked it — the human's bid, another CPU's
  --     raise, or the nomination that opened the market — so a mock that
  --     still reaches this line is one where nothing has happened since the
  --     market opened, and the responder will usually FOLD here (no
  --     candidate can beat the standing price). It is kept because the
  --     no-actor case is real: a market opened by a path that predates 091,
  --     or a board whose budgets moved under a commissioner edit between
  --     the open and now.
  --     Raise think-time (unchanged) = 20–70% of the BID clock from the
  --     last bid / the open (drafts.updated_at), seeded (draft, seq × 1000
  --     + bid count), or ~2s under `fast`; it gates THIS arm only — a
  --     reactive response is not timed at all, which is the §8.8 ruling and
  --     the reason the `fast`/`realistic` toggle no longer has any raise
  --     think-time to shorten (it still governs the NOMINATION think and
  --     ARM 2.5's snake picks). E62 is structural and unchanged: the cap is
  --     the validator's own number and draft_place_bid_internal re-enforces
  --     it; a decision the validator would refuse is recorded LOUDLY in

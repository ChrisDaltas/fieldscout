-- 170 — the backstop proof's schema half (M6 L.E1.31): the log-pointer
--       column guards, and acting_as_team_id on the three override twins of
--       the manager verbs (tasks-M6 §6 L.E1.31, TD10 (iii), TD16; spec §10.3,
--       §12.12; PROGRESS D441 (TD9), D343, D449, D450, D451; F513, F515)
-- ============================================================================
--
-- WHAT THIS IS. L.E1.31 proves that no commissioner path changes league
-- state without a `commissioner_actions` row, three ways (TD10): a catalog
-- census over pg_proc (pgTAP 118 §C), a behavioural matrix over every verb
-- (pgTAP 118 §M), and — this migration — triggers on every column that
-- POINTS AT the log, so that a pointer can only ever name the receipt the
-- writing transaction just produced. Plus one ruling the census forced
-- (D451): which receipts carry `acting_as_team_id`.
--
-- 1. THE COLUMN GUARDS (TD10 (iii); §12.12's "a DB trigger on overridable
--    tables … is a recommended backstop so no future code path can change
--    state without logging"; the D343 shape). The five columns that hold a
--    `commissioner_actions.id` (measured: every FK to the table over
--    001–169, pg_constraint):
--      matchups.override_action_id        (109:169, FK 123:459)
--      matchups.pairing_set_by_action_id  (134:161)
--      transactions.related_action_id     (109:249, FK 123:461)
--      league_weeks.reopened_by_action_id (056:68, FK 123:463)
--      league_weeks.scoring_rules_action_id (144:210)
--    (commissioner_actions.reverts_action_id is the log's own self-pointer:
--    the table is append-only (123 §1, 133) and the one writer, the logging
--    helper, never sets it — nothing to guard that 123's triggers do not.)
--    EVERY WRITER OF EACH COLUMN, MEASURED FIRST (comments stripped, over the
--    169 chain's prosrc — TD10 "the Builder measures every writer"):
--      override_action_id        commish_matchup_override_internal — SET to
--                                v_audit_id right after its log call (126)
--      pairing_set_by_action_id  commish_edit_bracket_internal — SET to
--                                v_audit_id after its log call (134); the
--                                bracket sync and state reads only READ it
--      related_action_id         commish_roster_override_internal and
--                                commish_force_or_reverse_trade_internal —
--                                INSERT transactions with v_audit_id, after
--                                their log calls (127 / 156)
--      reopened_by_action_id     NO WRITER (reopen_week is not built — Q64);
--                                110's transition guard only reads it
--      scoring_rules_action_id   commish_change_setting_internal — SET to
--                                v_audit_id after its log call (141 / 144);
--                                THE JOB: 144's backfill copies the league's
--                                own scoring-change receipt (source backfill /
--                                backfill_ambiguous); week open (144's
--                                trg_league_weeks_rules_1_open) writes NULL
--                                over NULL — not a change
--    THE RULE, one trigger function for all five (the column in TG_ARGV):
--      a CHANGE to the column (UPDATE: IS DISTINCT FROM OLD; INSERT: non-NULL)
--      is allowed only when the new value IS the id held in
--      app.commish_action_id — the receipt log_commissioner_action_internal
--      wrote in this transaction (123:447) — and, when that receipt exists,
--      it belongs to the row's own league (a missing one is left to the FK,
--      23503, so a dangling id keeps its old refusal). The one job arm: the
--      backfill's copy, guarded to exactly the value it copies (a
--      change_setting receipt of the week's own league for the key
--      scoring_system_id). Everything else — a direct owner-role or service-
--      role write outside a verb, a clear to NULL, a pointer at another
--      receipt — is REFUSED BY NAME (P0001, the table, the column, the row,
--      both values and the GUC).
--    THE GUC IS NOT THE SECURITY BOUNDARY (R1010, restated): no client role
--    holds a write policy on any of these three tables; the guard catches a
--    DEFINER body, a job, the service role or the owner writing a pointer
--    that no receipt in this transaction stands behind. A caller who forges
--    the GUC to an existing receipt's id of the same league gains nothing the
--    owner did not already have.
--    PLACEMENT. BEFORE INSERT (WHEN NEW.col IS NOT NULL) and BEFORE UPDATE
--    (WHEN NEW.col IS DISTINCT FROM OLD.col) — the WHEN clauses keep every
--    hot-path UPDATE (the scoring door, finalize, the carry) out of the
--    function (126's reasoning); the predicate is re-stated in the body so a
--    trigger recreated without its WHEN still guards. Named trg_zz_… so each
--    fires AFTER every existing BEFORE trigger on its table (triggers fire in
--    name order): it judges the row as 144's week-open stamp and 110's
--    transition guard leave it, and 110's own refusals keep their words.
--    ENABLE ALWAYS (R616: the default 'O' is skipped under
--    session_replication_role = replica — `db push`, pg_restore, logical
--    apply).
--
-- 2. acting_as_team_id ON THE OVERRIDE TWINS (D451 — the ruling the orchestrator
--    asked for on D450's side note, and what TD16's census needs). §10.3:711:
--    acting_as_team_id is "set when the commissioner acts on behalf of any
--    team, most commonly an orphaned one". Measured over the 169 chain:
--    set_lineup's commissioner arm (169), the claim and trade arms (M5), the
--    force pick and the autodraft switch (168) set it; commish_edit_lineup —
--    the tool a commissioner uses for an orphaned team after kickoff, §10.3's
--    own example — wrote the SAME action_type (edit_lineup) with it NULL.
--    THE RULE (D451): the team is set whenever the commissioner does, for ONE
--    team, what that team's manager could do himself — through the manager
--    verb's commissioner arm OR through its override twin. So, one hunk each
--    (the helper's last argument, NULL → the team):
--      commish_edit_lineup_internal     edit_lineup · the team (set_lineup's twin)
--      commish_roster_override_internal force_add / force_drop · the team on
--                                       the add / drop arm (roster_add_drop's
--                                       twin); a MOVE stays NULL — two teams,
--                                       for neither (D353's affected_team_ids)
--      commish_rename_team_internal     reassign_team · the team
--                                       (rename_own_team's twin)
--    NOT changed (no manager verb does it): score / result, FAAB, autopilot,
--    schedule, bracket, settings, the draft-room board controls, membership.
--    The receipt's other fields, every result, refusal, message and chat post
--    are byte-identical. League Home's activity line gains " (acting for
--    <team>)" on these three types, exactly as set_lineup's arm already reads
--    (activity-feed-ops.ts commishLogLines) — L.E1.34 owns that copy (F518).
--    THE FK: acting_as_team_id → teams (no ON DELETE; an immutable log). A
--    teardown that hard-deletes a team these receipts name takes F406's order
--    (detach teams → delete league → delete teams) — the stack suites that
--    call the three verbs are adjusted in this PR, named in D451.
--
-- D137 — each replaced body is derived from its NEWEST definer's FILE TEXT
-- (grep + md5 over 001–169; the source md5 equals the live prosrc on the 169
-- chain) by an exact-match script (derive_170.py: the substitution hits
-- exactly once, the reversal reproduces the source byte for byte; pgTAP
-- 118's pg_temp.un170 is the same reversal in the database):
--   commish_edit_lineup_internal     166:144   prosrc md5 cee39d86… → 467d4bd0…  1 hunk (+6 / -1)
--   commish_roster_override_internal 164:209   prosrc md5 a078d3e9… → 7ffd4e44…  1 hunk (+7 / -1)
--   commish_rename_team_internal     131:2304  prosrc md5 7c4a25c5… → 8a4e4eba…  1 hunk (+4 / -1)
-- Each hunk replaces the helper call's final `NULL` argument and adds its
-- comment; the REVOKE is restated after each (093 / 095 / 100 / 168 / 169
-- precedent). Older suites that pin these bodies by md5 apply pg_temp.un170
-- INNERMOST, so they pin exactly what they pinned (additive, R992).
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CHANGED, AND WHY (the census's allowlist — pgTAP 118 §C holds
-- each reason next to its name): leave_league / claim_league_invite (a
-- manager's or a joiner's own act — F515(b)); trade_vote (a manager's own
-- ballot — Q77 / D415(1): the commissioner does not cast another team's
-- vote, his power over a vote is approve / veto, receipted by
-- commish_force_or_reverse_trade); snapshot_league_scoring (a pre-draft copy
-- of the rules the league already references — draft start re-takes it,
-- 110:1138 / 168:3190 — so no commissioner input reaches game state; the
-- rules edits themselves are receipted, 169). No manager verb gains a
-- commissioner door: roster_add_drop and rename_own_team keep refusing him
-- on another team BY DESIGN — their own refusal copy names the override twin
-- he uses instead (transactions-service.ts / team-rename-service.ts; standing
-- rules (c) / (h); TD16 "delivered by override mode").
--
-- DEPLOY BEFORE PUSH (TD15). No route, hook, page or type changes shape. On
-- a database at 169 merged code behaves as today; at 170 the three receipt
-- types carry acting_as_team_id (League Home's line reads "(acting for
-- <team>)") and a pointer write outside a verb is refused — no app path
-- makes one (measured: src/ and scripts/ write none of the five columns).
--
-- MIGRATION CHECKLIST (tasks-M* §4.4)
--   New: 1 trigger function (PLAIN, search_path '', REVOKEd from PUBLIC /
--   anon / authenticated) + 10 triggers (ENABLE ALWAYS). Replaced: 3 bodies
--   (signatures, volatility, DEFINER-ness and search_path unchanged). No
--   table, column, index, policy or cron row. Time: none read. Typegen: no
--   change (no new callable function, no column). Realtime: none.
--   WAIVERS: R6 — no staging clone; rehearsal evidence = the fresh local
--   `db reset` 001–170 and the full pgTAP run in the PR. D38 — no backfill:
--   receipts written before 170 keep acting_as_team_id NULL (the log is
--   immutable, §12.12 — there is nothing to rewrite, and nothing may be);
--   the guards judge only a CHANGE to a pointer, so no existing row is
--   re-judged and no stored value has to satisfy them.
-- Rollback = DROP the ten triggers and the function; re-apply the three head
-- bodies named above verbatim.
--
-- Proof: pgTAP 118 (the census, the matrix, the manager-verb census, the
-- guard cells per column and per role, D137 in the database). Break probes
-- shown red then reverted in the PR.

      --
      --       `commish_edit_lineup` never hits this, because the player it
      --       benches STAYS ON THE ROSTER: he maps to the league, the drain
      --       visits the league-week, and `edited_by_commish` then forces the
      --       team. **A force-DROP deletes the roster row**, so the very row
      --       this verb queues maps to NO league and the drain never arrives —
      --       the enqueue is consumed having reached nothing and the stored
      --       points keep the dropped player, for ever. That is 123's own
      --       failure one layer out, and D346 did not anticipate it because it
      --       was written from the lineup verb's case.
      --
      --       So the verb ALSO queues players the league STILL rosters, drawn

      --       are there to make the drain VISIT this league-week at all. Each
      --       carries its OWN stamp and `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so a healthy

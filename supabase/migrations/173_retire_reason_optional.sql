-- 173 — retiring a team: the reason is OPTIONAL (M6 L.E1.40; F363(a), F546,
--       F262(a))
--       (spec §7.2.1(b), §10.3, §12.12, §15.1, E49; PROGRESS Q66 / C82, D290,
--        D320, D450, D461; standing rules (a), (f))
-- ============================================================================
--
-- THE DEFECT (F363(a), filed by L.E1.15 — measured again at task time).
-- `remove_manager`'s retire arm refused a blank reason:
--     RAISE 'remove_manager: retiring a franchise is an audited override —
--            a reason is required (E49 / D290)'  (22023, 169:761)
-- Q66 (spec v2.16.41; C82 in v2.16.77) ruled the commissioner's reason
-- OPTIONAL everywhere — audited always, never required. A verb refusing the
-- commissioner for want of a reason is a defect, not a question (standing
-- rules (a) / (f)); L.E1.15's sweep (131) fixed every other commissioner verb
-- and filed this one. E49's "audited override" is the AUDIT — the ledger row
-- (`transactions` commissioner_move) and the receipt (169's
-- `commissioner_actions` row) are written with or without a reason.
--
-- THE CHANGE — `remove_manager` only, `CREATE OR REPLACE` against its NEWEST
-- defining migration's FILE TEXT (D137; CLAUDE.md's 073 lesson — never the
-- deployed body). Newest definer MEASURED over 001–172 (grep of
-- `FUNCTION[^(]*remove_manager` + the chain): 063 → 120 → 146 → 150 → 169;
-- 170 / 171 / 172 do not define it. So the source is 169:642-1175, extracted
-- programmatically; three hunks applied by exact-match replacement (each hits
-- once; the reversal reproduces 169's text byte for byte — pgTAP 121 A3 pins
-- it in the database through `pg_temp.un173`):
--   H1 (+5 / -0) — the gate's comment says the reason is optional.
--   H2 (+1 / -5) — the gate becomes a NORMALISATION: blank or whitespace-only
--       (the explicit class ' \t\r\n', 123:295 — R1328: 169 trimmed spaces
--       only, so a tab-only reason passed the check and was stored NULL on
--       the receipt) is NULL; the `RAISE … a reason is required` goes. A
--       reason past 500 characters is refused BY NAME by the receipt seam
--       this body already calls (168:196 — "remove_manager: the reason is N
--       characters — at most 500 …", 22023) and the whole retirement rolls
--       back with it. (No second bound here: an earlier copy would give the
--       same answer from the same transaction — no test could tell them
--       apart, so it would be an unfalsifiable line.)
--   H3 (+4 / -1) — the D97 system post: `… — reason: ' || v_reason` would be
--       NULL for no reason, and `league_chat.message` is NOT NULL (001:531),
--       so the tail is a CASE: no reason, no "— reason:" clause (131's shape
--       for every other verb's post).
-- Everything else is byte-identical: the status gate (in_season / complete;
-- before the draft D42's refusal; the playoffs refused BY NAME pending
-- PROGRESS Q41), the own-seat guard (R858), `action_id` REQUIRED (the replay
-- stamp, 113's contract), the replay, the anti-coup and headless guards, the
-- never-managed refusal (R855), the seal, the successor, the inheritance
-- (the roster moves WHOLE to the successor; current and future weeks'
-- lineups / matchups / results re-point; earlier weeks stay the retired
-- team's — E49), the ledger row, the receipt, the notification, and the
-- takeover / vacate arms. The payload's `reason` is NULL when none was given
-- (a jsonb null, as the receipt's column is).
--
-- MIGRATION CHECKLIST (tasks-M* §4.4)
--   Replaced: 1 body (signature, volatility, SECURITY DEFINER, search_path ''
--   and the ACL unchanged — the REVOKE is restated verbatim). No table,
--   column, index, policy, trigger or cron row. Time: now() only (no new
--   clock read). Typegen: no change (no signature moved). Realtime: none new.
--   WAIVERS: R6 — no staging clone; rehearsal evidence = the fresh local
--   `db reset` 001–173 and the full pgTAP run in the PR. D38 — no backfill:
--   no retirement has ever been refused into a stored state (a refusal wrote
--   nothing), and a retirement stored before 173 keeps its reason.
-- Rollback = re-apply 169:642-1175 verbatim.
--
-- Proof: pgTAP 121 (form + D137 in the database; a blank / whitespace / tab /
-- absent reason RETIRES with the reason NULL on the payload, the ledger row
-- and the receipt, the post with no "— reason:" tail; a reason is stored
-- trimmed and posted; 501 characters refused by name with nothing written,
-- 500 accepted; the action_id still required; the playoffs still refused;
-- takeover / vacate untouched). 068 C0d re-cut to the ruled behaviour.
-- Break probes shown red then reverted in the PR.

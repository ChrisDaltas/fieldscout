-- ============================================================================
-- 160_faab_tie_rolling.sql — equal FAAB bids are broken by the ROLLING
-- waiver order by default, not by reverse standings (task L.D2.17, FULL
-- rigour — FAAB money; PROGRESS F478 discharged, D424).
-- Spec §7.3.4 row `faab_tiebreaker` (default now `rolling_priority`,
-- v2.16.69), §13.2 (the FAAB tie rule; "Priority before there are
-- standings" — Q72: rolling starts from reverse draft order and a team moves
-- to the back only when it wins a claim).
--
-- THE RULING (Chris, 2026-09-29, in chat): asked "When two teams bid the same
-- FAAB amount, the app breaks the tie by standings by default. Should it use
-- that same rolling waiver order instead, the way your leagues do?" —
-- "yes, use the rolling order". His context: "in my leagues the waiver
-- priority starts as soon as the draft is over and never resets. it just
-- keeps updating based on who used their waiver."
--
-- Numbering: reserved by the orchestrator and measured at build time (D161)
-- — `ls supabase/migrations | tail -1` → 159_faab_budget_range.sql,
-- `ls supabase/tests | tail -1` → 107_faab_budget_range.sql; so 160 /
-- pgTAP 108. Reaches production by `npx supabase db push` only. MEASURED
-- 2026-09-29 (read-only, Supabase MCP): the hosted database's newest applied
-- migration is 159 — so the push debt is 160 alone.
--
-- WHAT CHANGES
--   §1 process_waivers_internal — CREATE OR REPLACE against 157:2610-3165's
--      FILE TEXT (D137; definers 150 / 152 / 153 / 157 — 157 newest; its
--      prosrc md5 440a5950… = the live one, measured on the 159 chain),
--      ONE substitution, 1 hunk (+1 / -1): the fallback for a league whose
--      settings hold NO `faab_tiebreaker` key becomes 'rolling_priority'
--      (it was 'reverse_standings'). Nothing else in the body moves: a
--      stored key is read exactly as before, so a league that stores
--      'reverse_standings' still breaks ties by the standings. With the
--      rolling tiebreaker the run already (150 → 157, unchanged): starts
--      from the STORED order (`league_members.waiver_priority`) once one
--      exists, else from REVERSE DRAFT ORDER (Q72) — never from the
--      standings (they are read only when the order does not persist) —
--      sends every winner to the back at once (F422(a)) and writes the
--      rolled order back for the next run. That is Chris's "starts as soon
--      as the draft is over and never resets". The SQL twin
--      (`waiver_resolve_run_internal`, 150) has no default — it refuses an
--      input without `faabTiebreaker` — and is untouched; so is the TS
--      reference resolver (it takes the tiebreaker as a required input).
--      The TS default lives in `leagueSettingsSchema` (league-settings.ts)
--      and moves in the same PR; league-settings.test.ts pins that it
--      equals this file's fallback literal.
--   §2 faab_tiebreaker_old_default_rewrite_internal + one call — the stored
--      values the OLD default wrote. MEASURED: every app-created league
--      stores the key — `createLeague` parses the strict schema (defaults
--      filled) and `splitSettings` writes the whole blob, and the create
--      wizard has no tiebreaker field (league-create-modal.tsx) — so a
--      stored 'reverse_standings' is, except in one case, the old default
--      written implicitly. The exceptions it keeps: (a) a league whose
--      commissioner changed the key through `commish_change_setting`
--      (an audited `commissioner_actions` row, target 'faab_tiebreaker')
--      — an explicit choice; (b) a league that has already WON a waiver
--      claim — its winners were never recorded as a rolling order, so
--      switching it would restart the order from the draft (a reset, which
--      is exactly what the ruling says never happens). Every other league
--      storing 'reverse_standings' is rewritten to 'rolling_priority'. The
--      one undetectable case: a pre-draft commissioner who picked rolling
--      and then picked reverse standings back on the settings screen (the
--      setup PATCH is not audited) — recorded in D424. Hosted, measured
--      2026-09-29 (read-only): 1 live league, FAAB, in season, storing
--      'reverse_standings'; 0 audited tiebreaker changes; 0 waiver claims
--      of any status; 0 seats with a stored waiver priority ⇒ it is
--      rewritten, and its first waiver run starts from reverse draft order,
--      which is what the rolling order has been since its draft. Local:
--      0 leagues. The NOTICE names every league rewritten and kept.
--
-- DEPLOY BEFORE PUSH. Merging deploys the TS default at once (Vercel); the
-- database takes this file at Chris's `db push`. On 159: a NEW league
-- stores 'rolling_priority' explicitly (the schema fills it), which 159's
-- processor reads as stored — correct before the push. The one hosted
-- league keeps its stored 'reverse_standings' until the push rewrites it.
-- A row with no key (none exists hosted — measured) would read 'rolling'
-- in the app and 'reverse_standings' in 159's run until the push; the
-- settings reader stays tolerant (a missing key parses to the default).
--
-- MIGRATION CHECKLIST (tasks-M* §4.4)
--   One body replaced, signature unchanged (plain, search_path '', REVOKE
--   restated). One new PLAIN helper (search_path '', REVOKEd from PUBLIC /
--   anon / authenticated; it is called here and by pgTAP 108 only — never
--   by the app). It takes the league rows FOR UPDATE first (rule 8) and
--   asserts its UPDATE touched exactly the rows it chose. No table, column,
--   policy, index, grant, trigger or cron row. Time: none read. Typegen: the
--   helper joins `Functions` (additive; alias block re-appended). Realtime:
--   none. WAIVERS: R6 — no staging clone; rehearsal evidence = the fresh
--   local `db reset` 001–160 and the full pgTAP run in the PR. D38 — the
--   backfill is §2, stated above.
--   Older suites that pin 157's body (101 A12 / A13, 105 A4 / A5) reverse
--   160's substitution innermost (pg_temp.un160 — additive, the R992 shape)
--   so their literals stand; pgTAP 108 A pins 160's own.

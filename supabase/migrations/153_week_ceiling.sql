-- ============================================================================
-- 153_week_ceiling.sql — the Wednesday 00:00 Pacific week CEILING releases
-- every lock (PROGRESS F333 lock half + F424; task L.D2.10, FULL rigour —
-- locks decide who can move players; waivers; trades).
-- Spec §11.2 (the Release bullet — Q50's floor / trigger / ceiling; the
-- v2.16.58 Q78 note), §13.1 (the game-day lock), §13.2 (the waiver schedule:
-- "when the week ends … including the Q78 ceiling"), §13.3 (a deferred
-- trade, Q75); tasks-M5 TD15 / PROGRESS D404; D388(2), D406, D410(3), D411.
--
-- Numbering: measured at build time (D161) — `ls supabase/migrations | tail
-- -1` → 152_finished_week_lineups.sql, `ls supabase/tests | tail -1` →
-- 100_finished_week_lineups.sql; so 153 / pgTAP 101. NOT held: reaches
-- production by `npx supabase db push` only (push debt: 135–153).
--
-- THE RULING (Q78, Chris 2026-09-27, as recommended): if a Monday game is
-- postponed past Tuesday night, players still unlock at Wednesday 00:00
-- Pacific and waivers run on schedule; the unplayed game's points stay
-- pending (until it is played or the commissioner steps in — M8's operator
-- tools, Q37 / F243, NOT this migration).
--
-- THE CEILING, EXACTLY. `week_release_ceiling_internal(starts_at)` = the
-- first midnight wall-clock in America/Los_Angeles STRICTLY after
-- `starts_at + 168 hours`. `starts_at` is Wednesday 00:00 EASTERN (Tuesday
-- 20:00–21:00 Pacific), so that is the next Wednesday 00:00 Pacific — the
-- day after the week's Tuesday floor (Q50(a), `release-floor.ts`), read
-- through PostgreSQL's own zone rules: 07:00Z under PDT, 08:00Z under PST
-- (2026: week 7 → 2026-10-28 07:00Z, week 8 → 2026-11-04 08:00Z; the
-- fall-back is Sunday 2026-11-01). Anchored past the week's own seven days,
-- NOT on the floor's weekday walk, so no `starts_at` can put the ceiling
-- inside the week it closes (a mis-timed anchor walked to "the next Tuesday"
-- can land an hour later — a ceiling there would unlock players a week
-- early); on every real week the two agree (pinned over the whole seeded
-- calendar — pgTAP 101 A6). TS twin: `weekReleaseCeiling`, pinned to the same
-- literals (release-floor.test.ts and pgTAP 101 A4). Anchored on the WEEK,
-- never a kickoff (the floor's rule). NOTE: week N+1 has already begun at
-- the ceiling — its `starts_at` is Wednesday 00:00 EASTERN, three hours
-- earlier.
--
-- THE LOCK RELEASE. `week_lock_release_internal(last_game_ends_at,
-- starts_at)` = LEAST(COALESCE(last_game_ends_at, 'infinity'), ceiling): the
-- recorded all-final release (the floor or later), or the ceiling when that
-- comes first — including when nothing is recorded (NULL = a game unplayed).
-- It is a READ, never a stamp: `nfl_weeks.last_game_ends_at` keeps meaning
-- "the games are over", so `league_week_advance`, finalization, the
-- `all_final_unstamped` alert and scoring are UNTOUCHED (TD15 / D404; a
-- ceiling-closed week stays `live`, its unplayed cells pending).
--
-- WHO READS IT (every lock reader goes through 115's two helpers — measured:
-- `grep -n "pool_game_lock_any_internal\|pool_game_lock_internal"` over
-- supabase/migrations; no other SQL decides the game-day lock):
--   pool_game_lock_internal      locked := FALSE once the release has passed;
--                                `window_ends_at` reports the release when it
--                                is KNOWN (the recorded end, capped by the
--                                ceiling) and stays NULL while it is not —
--                                F238's loud state, so lineup_lock_tick still
--                                writes 'infinity' and 151's deferred trade
--                                still re-reads every minute (an ordinary
--                                Tuesday-floor release is never hidden behind
--                                the Wednesday ceiling). Signature and
--                                document shape unchanged.
--   pool_game_lock_any_internal  a week past its ceiling is no candidate.
--   ⇒ FOLLOW WITH NO EDIT: add/drop (152), the waiver claim submit + the
--     processor's locked set (150 / 152 — Q74 reads the lock at the run's
--     instant, so a run AT the ceiling awards a released player), the trade
--     lock + deferral (151's trade_lock_internal; R1202 — a trade parked at
--     `execute_after = 'infinity'` goes through at the ceiling), the
--     commissioner's bypass receipts (152), and the tick's pool view (139's
--     lineup_lock_tick: at the ceiling `locked_in_game` → `free_agent`,
--     `locked_until` → NULL).
--   waiver_window_internal (F424) the week's END for the free-agency window
--                                is its lock release — a postponed game no
--                                longer holds free agency open past the
--                                ceiling, and a run scheduled AT the ceiling
--                                counts (149's "a run AT the reset counts").
--
-- THE FINISHED WEEK (152's rule — the orchestrator's check, answered). The
-- four roster writers change lineups from the first UNFINISHED week:
-- `v_from_week = v_current + 1` once the current week's end ≤ p_at. At the
-- ceiling the current week is ALREADY N+1 whenever the league has a week-N+1
-- row (N+1 started three hours earlier), so the rule already leaves week N
-- alone — for everyone, played or not. The one exception is a league's LAST
-- week (no N+1 row, so the current week stays N): there 152's CASE read
-- `last_game_ends_at` NULL as "not over", and the ceiling — which releases
-- the played starters — would let a move clear a PLAYED starter's slot, the
-- exact F437 defect. So the CASE's week end becomes the same lock release
-- (one line in each writer): the ceiling finishes the week FOR LINEUPS as
-- well as for locks. WHAT THAT MEANS, stated: after the ceiling no move
-- changes week N's stored lineups — the played starters stay fixed, and a
-- player of the unplayed game stays where his team had him (his points stay
-- pending, with that team, per Q78). The week is NOT over for advance,
-- finalization or scoring. Before the ceiling nothing changes.
--
-- D137 — each replaced function is derived from its NEWEST definer's FILE
-- TEXT (measured by grep; no later migration defines any of them) by an
-- exact-match script (derive_153.py — every substitution asserted to hit
-- once; sources md5-asserted; hunks counted with difflib; pgTAP 101 §A
-- reverses every substitution on the LIVE prosrc and pins the source md5):
--   pool_game_lock_internal           115:225-274   md5 5797fe7b… → 4 hunks (+21 / -2)

--   waiver_window_internal            149:306-389   md5 89b9d86a… → 2 hunks (+7 / -2)
--   roster_add_drop_internal          152:103-638   md5 d36c2927… → 2 hunks (+7 / -2)

--   trade_execute_internal            151:755-1209  md5 e0246ff2… → 1 hunk  (+6 / -1)
-- (the 152 / 151 hunks: the DECLARE comment where 152 wrote one; the week
-- end's SELECT reads the lock release.)
--
-- DEPLOY BEFORE PUSH. Merging deploys app code at once; the hosted database
-- gets 153 only at Chris's `db push`. The app gains ONE pure TS function
-- (`weekReleaseCeiling`) that no route, page or job calls — nothing the app
-- reads changes shape (`locked_until` stays NULL / an instant / 'infinity',
-- 116's contract; every RPC document keeps its keys). Against a pre-153
-- database the app behaves exactly as today.
--
-- MIGRATION CHECKLIST (tasks-M* §4.4)
--   Two new PLAIN helpers (not DEFINER — pure reads of their arguments,
--   `search_path = ''`, REVOKEd from PUBLIC / anon / authenticated); seven
--   bodies replaced with signatures unchanged (ACLs kept; REVOKEs restated);
--   one COMMENT ON COLUMN refreshed (116's, 064 A12's pinned words kept). No
--   table, column, policy, index, grant, trigger or cron row. Time only
--   through p_at / the week's own starts_at (no clock read). Typegen: the two
--   helpers join `Functions` (additive; alias block re-appended). Realtime:
--   none new (the tick's existing pool broadcast fires on the flip).
--   WAIVERS: R6 — no staging clone; rehearsal evidence = the fresh local
--   `db reset` 001–153 and the full pgTAP run in the PR. D38 — nothing to
--   backfill: no stored row is rewritten; the next lineup_lock_tick refreshes
--   `league_player_pool.locked_until` from the helper (its only writer).

      --       visits the league-week, and `edited_by_commish` then forces the

      --       this verb queues maps to NO league and the drain never arrives —
      --       the enqueue is consumed having reached nothing and the stored

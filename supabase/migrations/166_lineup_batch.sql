-- ============================================================================
-- 166_lineup_batch.sql — the lineup batch (task L.D2.20, PROGRESS F500 +
-- F501; FULL rigour — lineups, the played lock, commissioner powers).
-- Spec §7.3.6 (allow_illegal_lineups: "If false, the slot is blocked at
-- submit. Either way, commissioner can flag & override"), §11.2 (the per-
-- player lock; the one-start bullet: "the lineup's record of his kickoff is
-- kept"), §10 / standing rule (g) (the commissioner stands outside TIMING;
-- a VALIDITY rule binds him too). PROGRESS D420 (157: the per-player datum,
-- the tick keeps a passed real record), D429 (165: the editor and the carry
-- read that datum; R1296 → F501), D413 (154: the kept off-roster start),
-- R739 (the manager's §7.3.6 exemption for a starter whose game kicked off).
--
-- Numbering: reserved by the orchestrator (166 / pgTAP 114) and measured at
-- build time (D161) — `ls supabase/migrations | tail -1` →
-- 165_editor_kickoff_record.sql, `ls supabase/tests | tail -1` →
-- 113_editor_kickoff_record.sql, main @ 9308c62. Reaches production by `npx
-- supabase db push` only (production is at 165; push debt: 166).
--
-- F500 — THE DEFECT (a rule-(g) defect, R1298). set_lineup_internal step
-- (10) exempts a STORED starter whose own game has kicked off from the
-- §7.3.6 submit gate (R739, 157:925-933 — "a locked slot's bye/OUT player
-- is not the manager's to change"). commish_edit_lineup_internal applied the
-- plain gate (123's choice: "a verb with no lock"), so with
-- allow_illegal_lineups = FALSE a starter who played Thursday and was then
-- designated OUT / IR / Suspended refused every commissioner fix to the week
-- that left him where he stood — unless the commissioner benched him, which
-- changes the week's score — while the manager's own re-save of the same
-- lineup landed. A timing refusal of the commissioner.
-- THE FIX (§1): the editor's gate carries R739's clause exactly as
-- set_lineup_internal has it — (his per-player kickoff is not NULL AND has
-- passed at p_at AND he is the stored occupant of that key) — no broader:
-- 157's measured rule has no other arm (the whole-week arm R739 also covered
-- was retired with first_game_of_week in 114). ONE spelling differs: the
-- stored-occupant test is NULL-SAFE (`IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`, not `=`).
-- In set_lineup a key that was empty makes `=` NULL, which never reaches
-- its gate (step (7b) refuses a kicked-off player entering a slot first);
-- the editor has no lock, so the literal copy let a moved OUT starter
-- through into an empty key (pgTAP 114 F4 caught it as first written). The
-- editor's own kept-start clause (154 / F441) is unchanged (its `=` has
-- the same NULL shape — filed F503, not widened here). What still binds
-- the commissioner, by name: a bye / OUT player put at any key he is not
-- stored at (moved, or started from the bench — the manager's gate refuses
-- the same map), the E16 fit, and the one-start trigger (154). pgTAP 114 §F.
--
-- F501 — THE DEFECT (R1296, pre-existing since 157). lineup_player_
-- kickoff_internal returns his CURRENT NFL team's kickoff whenever that has
-- passed, and consults what he played in only while it is ahead. So once a
-- starter who played Thursday and was traded to a Sunday team sees Sunday's
-- kickoff pass, every re-save that reads the datum records Sunday instead of
-- Thursday and can move locked_at. No lock or score consequence (both
-- instants have passed, so every "has he kicked off" reads true either way;
-- locked_at is a record, R779), but the record the spec keeps is lost.
-- THE FIX (§2): when his team's kickoff has passed, the helper prefers an
-- EARLIER kickoff he played in — (ii) a start this league recorded for a
-- real, passed kickoff of the week (lineup_played_internal's record arm,
-- guarded by lineup_record_kicked_off_internal — a flexed or postponed
-- game's old instant is not real, E42 / E43), else (iii) his stat line's
-- game (a real, passed kickoff of the week, not postponed). A stat line
-- naming NO game carries no instant (157's fallback there is the week's
-- first kickoff) and never displaces his team's kickoff. Only an EARLIER
-- played kickoff replaces a passed team kickoff, so a player who was not
-- moved by the NFL reads exactly as before (his record IS his team's game).
--
-- EVERY READER OF THE HELPER MEASURED (newest definers over 001–165,
-- `lineup_player_kickoff_internal(` — newest.py): set_lineup_internal
-- (157) ×2, lineup_autopilot_internal (157) ×1, commish_edit_lineup_internal
-- (165) ×2, lineup_carry_internal (165) ×1 — nothing else (pgTAP 114 A8
-- counts them in the database). Each follows by construction; the change is
-- confined to the branch where his team's kickoff has PASSED and the chosen
-- instant is earlier still, so for every reader:
--   * every lock test (`kickoff_at IS NOT NULL AND kickoff_at <= p_at` — set_
--     lineup (7a)/(7b)/(8) fixed/(9) IR timing/(10) R739; autopilot's locked
--     set; the editor's receipt and (10) gate) reads TRUE before and after;
--   * on_bye is FALSE before and after (his team has a game);
--   * what changes: starters[].kickoff_at, locked_at, the datum_arm and the
--     instant a refusal or a receipt names — the record, staying on the
--     game he played. pgTAP 114 §X / §M pin it writer by writer and over a
--     boundary matrix (every player × every instant: the lock and bye bits
--     equal under both helpers).
--   lineup_lock_tick (157) does NOT read the helper: arm (b) already keeps
--   a passed real record distinct from the team read (157), so it keeps the
--   Thursday record the writers now store (and could not restore one a
--   pre-166 writer overwrote — 114 X5). Its arm (c) writes autopilot's
--   document (above). The lock helpers (lineup_played_lock_internal / pool_
--   game_lock_player_internal) read lineup_played_internal, not this helper
--   — untouched.
--
-- WHAT IS UNCHANGED, STATED. Every refusal and message text (only the
-- instant / arm a message names can now be the played game's); the
-- commissioner still walks past every lock (moving a played starter is still
-- recorded in locked_players_moved); the kept-start judgment (164), the one-
-- start trigger (154), the E16 fit; scoring (§7.3.3 scores slot_map); a
-- player whose team's game is still ahead reads exactly as 157 wrote it.
-- No backfill (D38): a record a pre-166 re-save already moved to the new
-- team's kickoff is not re-judged — the played lock never depended on it
-- (both instants passed), and 157 / 165 made the same call.
--
-- D137 — each replaced body is derived from its NEWEST definer's FILE TEXT
-- (measured over 001–165: no later migration defines either) by an exact-
-- match script (derive_166.py — each substitution asserted to occur once,
-- its reversal asserted to reproduce the source byte for byte, the source
-- prosrc md5 equal to the live one on the 001–165 stack):
--   commish_edit_lineup_internal    165:145-988 prosrc md5 95d0b465… → dd36f9ef…  1 hunk  (+19 / -5)
--   lineup_player_kickoff_internal  157:275-308 prosrc md5 b14949f7… → a9b16bd7…  2 hunks (+32 / -0)
-- Every older suite that pins one of these bodies reverses 166 INNERMOST
-- (pg_temp.un166 — additive, the R992 shape) so its literal stands; pgTAP
-- 114 §A pins 166's own.
--
-- DEPLOY BEFORE PUSH. SQL + tests only — no route, page, job or type the
-- app reads changes shape: the documents keep their keys; a starter's
-- `kickoff_at` / `locked_at` may now read the game he played (display state
-- only — measured at 165: lineup-editor-ops.ts / box-score-service read them
-- as a record). Safe against a pre-166 database (the app calls nothing new).
--
-- MIGRATION CHECKLIST (tasks-M* §4.4)
--   New: nothing (no table, column, policy, index, trigger, cron row or
--   function). Two bodies replaced, signatures unchanged (ACLs kept;
--   REVOKEs restated); both PLAIN (every caller is an internal under a
--   DEFINER door or a job), search_path '' (unchanged); the helper's COMMENT
--   restated (its subject changed). Time only through p_at (no clock read).
--   The league row lock is unchanged — the editor takes it first (rule 8);
--   the helper only reads. Typegen: no change expected (no signature).
--   Realtime: none. WAIVERS: R6 — no staging clone; rehearsal evidence =
--   the fresh local `db reset` 001–166 and the full pgTAP run in the PR.
--   D38 — no backfill (above).

Read by set_lineup_internal step (6) and lineup_autopilot_internal (157), and since migration 165 (L.D2.19 — F497) by commish_edit_lineup_internal step (6) and lineup_carry_internal — every writer that computes a lineup''s kickoff record (the tick''s arm (b) keeps a passed real one, 157).';
